# ✅ OpenAI Integration - CONFIRMED WORKING

## Connection Status
- **API Key:** ✅ Connected and authenticated
- **Model:** gpt-4o-mini (active and responding)
- **Status:** Ready for production use

## What OpenAI is Used For

### 1. **Brand Name Generation** (`/lib/services/openai-generator.ts`)
When users use the **"Describe Business"** mode, OpenAI:
- Takes the business description
- Generates 40-60 creative brand names
- Creates names in 5 styles:
  - **Descriptive**: Clear business indication (e.g., "QuickBooks" for accounting)
  - **Suggestive**: Hints at benefits (e.g., "Netflix" suggests network/flicks)
  - **Coined**: Invented words (e.g., "Spotify", "Xerox")
  - **Blends**: Word combinations (e.g., "Pinterest" = Pin + Interest)
  - **Metaphorical**: Evocative concepts (e.g., "Amazon" for vastness)

### 2. **Name Fit Scoring** (`scoreNameFit` function)
For each generated name, OpenAI:
- Analyzes how well the name fits the business
- Considers memorability and pronounceability
- Evaluates relevance to the business description
- Provides a 0-100 fit score
- Generates a one-sentence rationale explaining why the name works

### 3. **AI Recommendations** (Future enhancement)
Currently in `/lib/helpers/recommendations.ts`, OpenAI can:
- Analyze availability results
- Suggest alternative names if the desired one is taken
- Provide strategic naming advice

## How It Works

### Generation Flow:
1. User describes their business in the chat interface
2. OpenAI generates 40-60 name candidates
3. System filters to top 30 based on basic criteria
4. Quick .com domain check reduces to 15 candidates
5. Deep availability checks on final 15
6. OpenAI scores each name's fit (0-100)
7. Returns top 10 names with full analysis

### API Calls per Generation:
- 1 call for initial name generation
- 15 calls for fit scoring (one per finalist)
- **Total: ~16 API calls per generation session**

## Cost Breakdown

Using **gpt-4o-mini**:
- Input: $0.150 per 1M tokens
- Output: $0.600 per 1M tokens
- Average generation session: ~5,000 tokens total
- **Cost per generation: ~$0.001-0.002**

### Monthly Estimates:
- 100 generations: ~$0.10-0.20
- 1,000 generations: ~$1-2
- 10,000 generations: ~$10-20

## Configuration

Current settings in `.env.local`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...  # ✅ Configured
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini    # Default model (optional)
```

## Test the Integration

### 1. Test via UI:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Describe Business" mode
3. Enter: "Sustainable coffee shop with coworking space"
4. Click "Generate Names"
5. Should see 10 branded names with scores

### 2. Test via Script:
```bash
node test-openai.js
```

### 3. Monitor Usage:
Check your OpenAI dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Troubleshooting

### If generation fails:
1. Check API key is valid
2. Verify you have credits (Settings → Billing)
3. Check rate limits aren't exceeded
4. Look for errors in browser console

### Common Issues:
- **"Insufficient quota"**: Add credits to OpenAI account
- **"Invalid API key"**: Regenerate key and update .env.local
- **"Rate limit"**: Wait a minute or upgrade tier

## Future Enhancements

Potential uses for OpenAI:
1. **Industry Analysis**: Understand business context better
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Identify naming patterns in industry
3. **Linguistic Analysis**: Check names in multiple languages
4. **Tagline Generation**: Create matching taglines
5. **Logo Concepts**: Describe visual identity ideas

## Security Notes

- API key is server-side only (never exposed to client)
- All OpenAI calls happen in Edge Functions
- No user data is stored by OpenAI
- Responses are cached for 1 hour to reduce costs
